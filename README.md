# Gitops Basics Workshop
Welcome to the Gitops Basics Workshop!

Gitops presents a series of changes, challenges and advantages vs a more imperative approach. 
In this session we're gonna focus on understanding the following:

* How do we deploy a gitops service
* How does the yaml configuration correlate to resources?
* Rollbacks, promotions, operability
* Canary deployments and how to reduce blast radius

A basic understanding of what gitops means is necessary. 
If this is the first time you heard the term, please read the [first two bullet points of the following documentation](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops)

**PLEASE REPLACE EVERY INSTANCE OF `<YOUR-NAME>` with your name**

## Requirements
This workshop is developed in an OSX operative system. Please notice that some things may change in other OS.

You will need:
* Kubernetes local cluster (You can use kind, k3d or colima for this):
    
    Kind:

     kind create cluster --name gitops-workshop-sample
    ```
    k3d: (recommende for m1)
    ```
     brew install k3d
     k3d create cluster gitops-workshop-sample
    ```
    colima: 
    ```

git commit -m "Rename placeholder with name" 
git push -u origin <YOUR-NAME>-gitops-workshop
```

## Tasks
### Task 0 - Setting up ArgoCD + Argo Rollouts
In order to have a Gitops-like deployment, we need a combination of ArgoCD which will track the code for changes and Argo Rollouts which will enable us to have different deployment strategies and options.

We have written a makefile to ease up the local installation of ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts. 
Make sure you're connected to your cluster and execute
```
make setup
``` 

Now we want to keep track of our ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts, you can make the dashboards available by running
```
make dashboard
```

* ArgoCD Dashboard: http://localhost:8888 
  * user: admin
  * password: Execute `kubectl -n argo-cd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d`
* Argo Rollouts Dashboard: http://localhost:3100



You may get rid of the port-forward that enables dashboards at any time by running
```
kill $(lsof -t -i :8888)
kill $(lsof -t -i :3100)
```

### Task 1 - Deploying our Gitops configuration
Let's proceed and install a the configuration for our service.
In order to get our service running, we need to understand that there's more than the app itself:
- The application we wanna deploy (In a docker image form)
- The configuration for our application (CPU and Memory, replicas, env vars, secrets...)
- The configuration for the Gitops approach tracking (Repository to track, Helm chart version, target K8S cluster... This information was previously on Spinnaker Dinghyfile)

In this first task we're gonna focus on the third step first.

**REMEMBER TO RENAME EVERY `<YOUR-NAME>` IN THE REPO BEFORE PROCEEDING**

1. Install the dependencies
```
kubectl apply -f 01-gitops-dependencies/namespace.yaml
kubectl create -f 01-gitops-dependencies/project.yaml
```
This creates us three resources
- Our working namespace
- Our ArgoCD Project. This is used to limit which namespaces, resources, etc can be modified inside it.

2. Install the gitops application
```
kubectl apply -f 02-gitops-application/application.yaml
```

This is creating our ArgoCD Application, the key piece that will track our service values, let's observe it.

1. Check ArgoCD + Argo Rollouts deployment
A first deployment of the surrounding resources and application will start until eventual completion.
This may include everything you can be familiar with: secrets, the ingress (ALB), the service, the confimaps with configurations...
One that you may not recognise is the Rollout. This is the actual CRD that will create the ReplicaSets and lastly the Pods
[IMAGE]

When the rollout is in progress, it's time to go to Argo Rollouts to see what is happening.
This is where we will handle all the operations to rollback, promote, etc.
[IMAGE]

Once our Rollout is complete, we're done with the first task
[IMAGE]

We recommend that you leave both ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts dashboards open

### Task 2 - Operating our application

Gitops tracks changes on the code to trigger a deployment. Let's modify the CPU and color

### Deploy
1. Modify your resources.request.cpu from `0.2` to `0.5` and switch from `color: "red"` to `color: "blue"` on `deployment/kubernetes/test/values.yaml`
2. Push the changes to your branch `<YOUR-NAME>-gitops-workflow`
3. Observe how ArgoCD picks up the change (may take a couple minutes, you can alternative Hard Refresh to speed it up) and triggers a new deployment on Argo Rollouts
[IMAGE]

When the pods are stable, a waiting time to downscale the old deployment will happen, then it will stabilise.
[IMAGE]

### Rollback
Let's say we wanna rollback what we did, how do we do that?
1. In Argo Rollouts, select the previous revision and click on rollback
2. Once you trigger a rollback, Argo Rollouts will scale up those replicas.
3. This will create a drift on the application, that will be the signal for us to either leave the code back on the old version, or release a hot fix for a new one.
[IMAGE]

### Canary deployments
Now that we know how to deploy and rollback a change, let's get into the world of Canary!
Canary deployments essentially provide us a much finer control of the traffic, allowing for things such as deploying traffic progressively, or split for AB testing.

#### Default behaviour
1. Our service is currently set in BlueGreen. In order to set the deployment strategy to Canary, let's switch our `values.yaml`
From
```
kind: blueGreen
strategy:
  blueGreen:
    config:
      autoPromotion: true
      autoPromotionSeconds: 30
      scaleDownDelaySeconds: 30
```

To
```
kind: canary
strategy:
  canary:
    config:
      scaleDownDelaySeconds: 30 
```
1. Push your changes and observe what happens on Argo rollouts
[IMAGE]

  * On the left side you can see the default steps that will happen on a deployment: Set weight of new deploy on 20%, wait for 2 mins, then 40%, wait...
  * In the Summary, you can see the current strategy,the current weight set plus the one on the infra.
  * The rest is pretty much the same as it was

1. Let's deploy a new version of the app by updating the color from `color: "blue"` to `color: "green"`
2. The different steps will happen, now this is important
  * To skip one step, click on Promote
  * To skip the entire canary up to 100%, click on PromoteFull
**THIS ALLOWS FOR A QUICK PROMOTION ON HOTFIXES**

#### Customising steps
When no steps are selected, those are the default ones that happen, but this is completely customisable. 
1. Let's set our own steps to migrate 50%, lets add the following to values.yaml
```
canary:
  steps:
    - setWeight: 50
    - pause:
        duration: 30s
    - setWeight: 100
```
2. Push your changes and check Argo Rollouts again
3. You may check a new deployment by changing any resource

#### Custom Headers
One last case we want to portrait is Custom Headers.
In some cases, instead of progressively redirect traffic you may wanna target something specifically. e.g a country, mobile users...

To do this, we have the option to pass the new version setting a Custom Header, this way if the app requests with that header, the new version of our application will receive the request. 

1. Lets set our steps to the following:
```
canary:
  steps:
    - setWeight: 10
    - setHeaderRoute:
        name: header-route
        match:
          - headerName: Target-Canary
            headerValue:
              exact: "true"
    - pause: {}
    - setHeaderRoute:
        name: header-route
    - setWeight: 100
```
Due to a limitation with Custom Headers, some traffic must always go to the new version (The initial 10), more on this to be investigated

2. Push your changes and check Argo Rollouts again
3. Here is where things get interesting.
   We have set an indefinite pause, things won't move until we promote the step manually.
   1. Wait until the Custom-Header is active
   [IMAGE]

   2. Curl both endpoints and observe the different returned value
      * Curl the old deployment by running 
      ```
      curl http://localhost
      ```
      * Curl the new deployment 10 times by running
      ```
      curl -H "Target-Canary=true" http://localhost
      ```
   3. Promote your app deployment on Argo Rollout
   4. Repeate the same curls. Only one color is returned this time.

Custom Headers allow for more matching configurations, more documentation [here](https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/traffic-management/#traffic-routing-based-on-a-header-values-for-canary)
